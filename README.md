# Regoliath
Mod that adds the Regoliath event and unlockable ship to the game FTL: Faster Than Light. Latest version: 1.0

Requires the [Hyperspace mod](https://github.com/FTL-Hyperspace/FTL-Hyperspace) for the multi-page ship list, as it does not replace any vanilla ship.

The release SquareCruiser.zip contains folders "data", "img" and "mod-appendix". Change the file extension from .zip to .ftl to use as a mod with the [Slipstream Mod Manager](https://github.com/Vhati/Slipstream-Mod-Manager).

If what you see in-game does not match the advertised description, please submit an issue, or contact me on Reddit (CommunistMountain) or Discord (CommunistMountain#0463).
